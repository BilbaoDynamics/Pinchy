[Pinchy](http://bilbaodynamics.com/pinchy) is presented as the second iteration of our previous robot, [uBot](http://bilbaodynamics.com/tenacitas). It is an **educational** robot specifically made to be used as an ideal medium to start learning to program, know more about robotics and familiarize yourself with the basic electronic concepts.

### What's this?

Pinchy is an **open source** educational robot that can be printed using ordinary 3D printers. It's made up of a PCB, used as a shield with an Arduino Micro on top of it, the before mentioned chasis and some sensors to interact.

## Files

### Chasis

The chasis that makes this robot more than a custom PCB with an Arduino is made with our 3D printers helping us to reduce the costs of assembling a fully functional educational robot. All the necessary files are [here](https://github.com/BilbaoDynamics/Pinchy/tree/master/Chasis).

The circuitry that is needed is in the [Circuits](https://github.com/BilbaoDynamics/Pinchy/tree/master/Circuitos) folder, there you can find the schematics and the CAD files for the main PCB and for the custom-made optoreflectors.
